# tic tac toe!

## To Do:

- ~Indicate which player is playing currently by high-lighting active player~
- ~When a player clicks cell, icon ( 'O' or 'X') gets rendered~
- ~ID of the cell gets pushed to each players array~

- ~After 3rd click (per player)~
  - ~function hasWon => check the current player's array to see if it matches winning pattern~
    - ~If winning ->~
      - ~cells of winning pattern gets high-lighted~
      - ~Player chip gets high-lighted~
    - ~Else -> next player plays (hasWon)~

## To do list for pair programming:

I could like to add features below to 'Play again!' button when a player clicks:

- remove 'won!' or 'tied' badge
- remove all x and O icons 
- enable cell buttons
- enable 'Play again!' button
